The task is to choose the safe place in the circle
so that when you perform these operations starting 
from 1st place in the circle, you are the last one remaining and survive.

class Solution
{
    public:
    int josephus(int n, int k)
    {
       if(n==1){
           return 1;
       }
       else{
           return (josephus(n-1 ,k)+k-1)%n+1; // each  time element reduce and new value is written which must be round to get result in the limit of element;
        }//Your code here
    }
};
